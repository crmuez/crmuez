## üë©‚Äçüíª Cristina here ‚Äî coding one semicolon at a time!

Currently studying software development at **42 M√°laga**, where I‚Äôve taken on an active role as a **Sensei** ‚Äî supporting new students, collaborating with the pedagogical team, and helping foster a strong learning community.
With a background in **event management** and **content writing**, I‚Äôve developed strong skills in leadership, communication, teamwork, and organization ‚Äî all of which I now apply in tech environments.

I'm focusing on **technical support**, **databases (SQL, Transact-SQL)**, **Microsoft tools** (Power BI, Power Query, Power Pivot), and **virtual environments** (Citrix), with a growing interest in **public cloud** platforms like **Azure** and **AWS*

üéÆ Volunteer at **M√°lagaJam**, helping organize events and activities that promote creativity, collaboration, and inclusivity in the video game industry.

Always eager to keep learning and growing within the IT world.

##  Other Technical Knowledge

As I continue learning and growing, I'm diving into more complex areas that are fundamental to creating efficient, secure, and scalable systems:

- **Concurrency & Multithreading**: I‚Äôm diving into **mutexes**, **threads**, and synchronization techniques to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and keep everything running smoothly.
- **Networking & Protocols**: Networking is key to how systems communicate, so I‚Äôm building real-world simulations and solving exercises involving key protocols like **TCP/IP**, **UDP**, and **HTTP** to understand how everything connects and functions.
- **Basic Cybersecurity**: Security is essential in today‚Äôs world. I‚Äôm building knowledge in **incident prevention** and **incident analysis**, learning how to identify vulnerabilities and protect systems from common threats.
