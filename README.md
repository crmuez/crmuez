## 👩‍💻 Cristina here — coding one semicolon at a time!

Currently studying software development at **42 Málaga**, where I’ve taken on an active role as a **Sensei** — supporting new students, collaborating with the pedagogical team, and helping foster a strong learning community.
With a background in **event management** and **content writing**, I’ve developed strong skills in leadership, communication, teamwork, and organization — all of which I now apply in tech environments.

I'm focusing on **technical support**, **databases (SQL, Transact-SQL)**, **Microsoft tools** (Power BI, Power Query, Power Pivot), and **virtual environments** (Citrix), with a growing interest in **public cloud** platforms like **Azure**.

🎮 Volunteer at **MálagaJam**, helping organize events and activities that promote creativity, collaboration, and inclusivity in the video game industry.

Always eager to keep learning and growing within the IT world.

##  Other Technical Knowledge

My technical journey is focused on providing solid and efficient support in IT environments. Here are some of the areas I'm actively developing:

**Incident Management**: I’m gaining experience in identifying, reporting, and documenting incidents efficiently. I understand the importance of prioritization and escalation, and I’m learning how to resolve first-level issues and when to involve higher-level support.

**Monitoring & Troubleshooting**: I’m familiar with system monitoring practices and learning to detect potential issues before they affect users. I’m developing structured troubleshooting approaches to respond quickly and accurately.

**Virtual Environments & Remote Access**: I'm working with platforms like Citrix and exploring virtual desktops and remote infrastructure, learning how to operate within them and support end-users effectively.

**Documentation & Communication**: I understand the value of clear, up-to-date documentation and communication within support teams and with users — both crucial for delivering a high-quality service.

**Customer-Oriented Mindset**: My experience in event coordination and volunteering has strengthened my empathy, patience, and ability to remain calm under pressure — qualities I now bring to technical support roles.
