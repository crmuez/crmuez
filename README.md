##  Other Technical Knowledge

My technical journey is focused on providing solid and efficient support in IT environments. Here are some of the areas I'm actively developing:

**Incident Management**: I‚Äôm gaining experience in identifying, reporting, and documenting incidents efficiently. I understand the importance of prioritization and escalation, and I‚Äôm learning how to resolve first-level issues and when to involve higher-level support.
**Monitoring & Troubleshooting**: I‚Äôm familiar with system monitoring practices and learning to detect potential issues before they affect users. I‚Äôm developing structured troubleshooting approaches to respond quickly and accurately.
**Virtual Environments & Remote Access**: I'm working with platforms like Citrix and exploring virtual desktops and remote infrastructure, learning how to operate within them and support end-users effectively.
**Documentation & Communication**: I understand the value of clear, up-to-date documentation and communication within support teams and with users ‚Äî both crucial for delivering a high-quality service.
**Customer-Oriented Mindset**: My experience in event coordination and volunteering has strengthened my empathy, patience, and ability to remain calm under pressure ‚Äî qualities I now bring to technical support roles.
