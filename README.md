## ðŸ’» About Me

Hey! I'm **Cristina**, a passionate software development student at **Campus 42**, part of the **TelefÃ³nica Foundation**.  
At 42, I'm not just learning to code â€“ Iâ€™m solving real-world problems, collaborating with brilliant peers, and diving into challenges that push me to grow. The program is all about **learning by doing**, where there are no traditional lectures, just hands-on projects that make the learning process exciting and rewarding.  
I believe in **self-paced learning**, where you set your own path and continuously improve through teamwork, perseverance, and practical experience.

## ðŸ§  Other Technical Knowledge

As I continue learning and growing, I'm diving into more complex areas that are fundamental to creating efficient, secure, and scalable systems:

- **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Iâ€™m diving into **mutexes**, **threads**, and synchronization techniques to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and keep everything running smoothly.
- **Networking & Protocols**: Networking is key to how systems communicate, so Iâ€™m building real-world simulations and solving exercises involving key protocols like **TCP/IP**, **UDP**, and **HTTP** to understand how everything connects and functions.
- **Basic Cybersecurity**: Security is essential in todayâ€™s world. Iâ€™m building knowledge in **incident prevention** and **incident analysis**, learning how to identify vulnerabilities and protect systems from common threats.
